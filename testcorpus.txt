Top Mistakes You’re Making in Text Conversations (And How to Fix Them)
Texting can feel like walking through a minefield. One wrong word, and the conversation blows up in your face. To make your text interactions more engaging and less stressful, steer clear of these common mistakes:

Autocorrect is Not Your BFF: While it’s tempting to rely on autocorrect, sometimes it changes your message in ways that can be utterly confusing or downright embarrassing.
Bad example (autocorrect): “I can’t wait to eat your coughing!”

Good example (proofread): “I can’t wait to eat your cooking!”

Actionable Tip: Always proofread your texts before hitting “send.”

Emoji Overload 🤪: Emojis are the spices of the texting world; use them sparingly to add flavor but avoid overwhelming the dish.
Bad Example: “Movie night? 🎬 So excited to catch that new action film! 🍿💥🔫🚁🔥 And we absolutely have to try the garlic popcorn! 🍿🧄🍿🧄🤤 Can’t wait to see you! 😍👫💕🎉”

Good Example: “Movie night? Excited for the new action film! And curious about garlic popcorn! 🧄 Can’t wait to see you! 😍”

Actionable Tip: Limit yourself to one or two emojis per message unless you know the other person well and are sure they appreciate the extra flair.

Text Walls: Sending a giant block of text is like asking someone to read a mini essay on their phone.
Bad Example: “Well on the first day of this trip I bet you’ve never been parachuting before, have you? We’ll start with parachuting into the Amazon, which is going to be awesome!!! Afterwards, we’ll take a break. But not for long, as we will then wrangle anacondas. They’re a big snake, for sure. Then afterward we plan to discover El Dorado. It’ll be my 10th time there! Oh yeah, and we will end the day before having dinner with Bigfoot.”

Good Example:

“Amazon adventure first! 🪂”

“Anaconda wrangling. 🐍”

“El Dorado hunt. 🏆”

“Bigfoot dinner. 🦶”

Actionable Tip: Break your messages into smaller, digestible chunks. Don’t be afraid of sending multiple messages. It makes for easier reading and better engagement.

Assuming Tone: Because texts lack vocal cues, it’s easy to misinterpret tone. What you intend as a joke may come off as sarcastic or even rude.
Bad Example: “Did you really summon Cthulhu at the office party?”

Good Example: “Did you really summon Cthulhu at the office party? 😂 Just checking if we need to prepare for the apocalypse!”

Actionable Tip: When discussing sensitive or complex topics, make your tone as clear as possible. If in doubt, clarify your intent with an extra sentence or an appropriate emoji.

The ‘K’ Culprit: Responding with just ‘K’ might be efficient, but it can also feel dismissive.
Bad Example: “K”

Good Example: “OK! That idea’s so good it deserves an exclamation point!”

Actionable Tip: Add a little more context or emotion. Even a simple “Ok, sounds good!” can make all the difference.

Should You Text or Talk? The Ultimate Dilemma, Solved!
Should you talk or text? While both methods have their merits, choosing the wrong one can sour the experience. Here’s how to make the right call (or text):

Texting	Talking
Pros	Convenience: You can text at any time, from anywhere. Perfect for a quick “Thinking of you” during a meeting.	Emotional Nuance: The warmth in a “Good morning” greeting can make someone’s day.
Less Intrusive: You don’t interrupt the recipient’s day; they can read and reply when it suits them.	Immediate Feedback: If someone is confused or excited, you’ll know right away.
Multitasking-Friendly: You can text while cooking, watching TV, or waiting in line.	Faster Resolution: Complex issues often get sorted quicker when discussed directly.
Conversation Record: Texts can be reviewed, making it easier to remember details or instructions.	Enhanced Personal Connection: Voice nuances add an extra layer of closeness.
No Awkward Pauses: You have time to think about your replies, so the conversation flows more naturally.	Clarifies Intent: It’s easier to express sarcasm or seriousness verbally.
Cons	Misunderstood Tone: A sarcastic “Great job” might not read as sarcastic.	Mutual Availability: Both parties need to be free, which is increasingly rare.
Lack of Depth: The conversation may not go beyond surface-level chatter.	Potential for Awkwardness: Silence on a phone call feels far more uncomfortable than in a text chat.
Delayed Responses: The lag can make conversations drag on unnecessarily.	Disturbance: A call interrupts whatever the other person is doing.
Distraction Hazard: You might end up mindlessly scrolling through other apps.	No Records: Unless recorded, details of the conversation can be forgotten.
Less Personal: There’s no voice tone, pitch, or timbre to enrich the conversation.	Not Multitasking-Friendly: Requires more focus, making multitasking difficult.
Action Step: Do a quick mental rundown of these factors and then decide. When in doubt, there’s no harm in asking the other person their preference.

Key Takeaways: How to Have a Great Conversation Over Text
Compared to phone calls and in-person conversations, texting is a pretty low-stake form of communication. You can push some boundaries and take solace in the fact that it’s only a text message, after all. Why not set yourself apart from the millions of other texts and try something new? 

If you don’t know where to start, remember these tips for creating a sound text thread:  

Keep it short: People move fast today, and messages are no different. Texts are for short blurbs, not novels. Giant chunks of words can be hard on the eyes, so it’s best to keep your initial conversation starters to a few lines or less. When in doubt, a little mystery may warrant a better response. 
Ask questions: The art of a regular conversation still applies via text. People love to talk about themselves, so they express interest in what they have to say by asking questions. 
Spark interest: Most people get asked “how are you?” or “what do you do for a living?” several times a day. You can generate a far more intriguing text conversation by bringing up unique topics, funny references, or unconventional subjects. 
Compliment them: Who doesn’t love a positive message on their phone? Whether you’re trying to flirt or initiate a conversation with a friend, typing a nice compliment is an easy way to brighten your day.    
Reference something they said: When in doubt, you can always bring up past conversations that you want to continue. For example, if you previously discussed travel and your friend mentioned that they’ve always wanted to visit Greece, you can reignite the topic via text and ask about their specific interest in that destination. It shows that you’ve been paying attention and want to learn more. 
Use emojis or GIFs: The most significant thing missing from texts is nonverbal communication like facial expressions. Emojis and GIFs help people understand when we’re being goofy, flirty, or profound. Plus, they can make texting more fun. Read about the top 45 Emojis You Should Know and Their (Hidden) Meanings. 
No matter how far technology progresses, the basics of human connection and the art of conversation remain the same. If you want to uplevel your communication skills over text and in-person, learn How to Have and Hold a Dazzling Conversation With Anyone.
